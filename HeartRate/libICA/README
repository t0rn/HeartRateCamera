- execute "make" & "make install" to install libICA
- libICA is instaled in /usr/local per default. You can change the destination
  by editing the INSTALL_PREFIX variable in the Makefile.
- The example program (fastICA) is compiled but not installed. 
- If you will try the program without installing libICA (no "make install"),
  execute the following command to make the dynamic linking work:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
